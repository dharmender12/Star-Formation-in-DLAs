# Star-Formation-in-DLAs
This code is based on the methods described in the paper available at https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202452542. I extended the original implementation by developing a program that fits spectral lines and enables the detection of emission features in Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) systems using spectral stacking techniques.

This repository contains code inspired by the methods described in this paper.
Building on the original approach, I have extended the implementation to include:

Automated fitting of spectral lines.

Detection of emission features in Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) systems.

Spectral stacking techniques for enhanced analysis.

These tools together provide a framework for studying star formation in DLAs through emission-line diagnostics.
