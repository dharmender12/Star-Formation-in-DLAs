# Star-Formation-in-DLAs
This code is based on the methods described in the paper available at https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202452542. I extended the original implementation by developing a program that fits spectral lines and enables the detection of emission features in Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) systems using spectral stacking techniques.
