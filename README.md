# Star Formation in DLAs

This repository contains code for analyzing star formation in Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) systems, inspired by the methods described in the paper: Star Formation in DLAs. The implementation has been extended to include advanced spectral analysis tools for studying emission-line diagnostics in DLAs.
Features

Automated Fitting of Spectral Lines: Tools for fitting spectral lines to identify and quantify emission features in DLA systems.
Detection of Emission Features: Algorithms for detecting emission lines in DLA spectra, enabling the study of star formation activity.
Spectral Stacking Techniques: Methods for stacking spectra to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and improve analysis of faint emission features.

Requirements
To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8+
NumPy
SciPy
Astropy
Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using:
pip install numpy scipy astropy matplotlib

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-formation-dlas.git


Navigate to the repository directory:cd star-formation-dlas


Install the dependencies as listed above.

Usage

Data Preparation: Place your spectral data files (in FITS or compatible format) in the data/ directory.
Running the Analysis:
Use fit_spectral_lines.py to perform automated spectral line fitting.
Use detect_emission.py to identify emission features in DLA spectra.
Use stack_spectra.py for spectral stacking and enhanced analysis.Example command:

python fit_spectral_lines.py --input data/spectrum.fits --output results/


Output: Results, including fitted parameters and stacked spectra, are saved in the results/ directory.
